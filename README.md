# DNN-based-Anomaly-detection

**Project Overview:**

This project focuses on enhancing the predictive accuracy of a neural network model through a two-step process involving Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and booster models. The objective is to improve the performance of the initial neural network (referred to as the source model) by refining its predictions using a booster model trained on pseudo-labels generated by the source model.

**Steps Involved:**

1. **PCA:** Principal Component Analysis is applied after standardization to reduce the dimensionality of the data. This helps in capturing the most important patterns and relationships in the data while reducing noise and computational complexity.

2. **Source Model:** The source model is the initial neural network trained on the original dataset. It learns the primary patterns and relationships in the data and establishes a baseline for performance.

3. **Booster Model:** The booster model is trained on pseudo-labels generated by the source model's predictions. It aims to enhance or refine the predictions made by the source model, correcting errors and improving overall accuracy.

**Workflow:**

1. Standardize the data.
2. Apply PCA to reduce dimensionality.
3. Train the source model on the standardized and PCA-transformed data.
4. Generate pseudo-labels using the source model's predictions.
5. Train the booster model on the original features and pseudo-labels.
6. Evaluate the booster model's performance and compare it with the source model.
